# Taylorizer
This is a personal project which is used to replace the stolen Taylor songs in Spotify playlists with (Taylor's Version)!
This project is written in JavaScript (I use the bun interpreter!)
## How do I use it?
The code in action can be found at [my github page](https://ctrleo.github.com/taylorizer)
### Can I run my own instance?
Absolutely! Just make your own application with [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/) and then run index.js as your backend and use the web folder as the root of your frontend.
_(Note: Web folder not created yet because frontend is not finished)_
**Make sure to set the environment variables used in index.js**
